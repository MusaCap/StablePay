## 1. Overview
StablePay Wallet is a mobile-first crypto wallet that allows users to **send and receive USD-backed stablecoin payments** while connecting to the **Bridge API** for direct fiat banking, ACH, and card integrations.  

This product merges the simplicity of fintech apps (e.g., Venmo, CashApp) with the transparency and low fees of blockchain.

## 2. Goals & Objectives
- **Primary Goal:** Enable borderless USD stablecoin payments with seamless fiat connectivity via Bridge API.

## 3. User Stories
- As a **consumer**, I want to load my wallet with USD from my bank account via Bridge API, so I can send stablecoins to friends.  
- As a **merchant**, I want to settle transactions in USDC or back to USD in my bank, so I can manage cash flow easily.  
- As a **new crypto user**, I want to sign up quickly with my bank details, so I don’t need to understand blockchain wallets.  
- As a **power user**, I want to select the chain (Base, Polygon, Solana), so I can optimize for fees and speed.

- **Phase 3 (6–12 months):** Non-custodial upgrade, B2B APIs, cross-border remittance.  

---

## 9. Open Questions
- Should fiat <> stablecoin conversion always flow through Bridge API, or allow 3rd-party on-ramps (e.g., MoonPay) as fallback?  
- Should we sponsor gas fees for small-value payments (<$50)?  
- What regional compliance constraints should we prioritize first (US, EU, LATAM)?
